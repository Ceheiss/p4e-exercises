## Instructions

This application will read roster data in JSON format, parse the file, and then produce an SQLite database that contains a User, Course, and Member table and populate the tables from the data file.

You can base your solution on this code: http://www.py4e.com/code3/roster/roster.py - this code is incomplete as you need to modify the program to store the role column in the Member table to complete the assignment.

Each student gets their own file for the assignment. Download this file and save it as roster_data.json. Move the downloaded file into the same folder as your roster.py program.

Once you have made the necessary changes to the program and it has been run successfully reading the above JSON data, run the following SQL command:

```sql
SELECT User.name,Course.title, Member.role FROM
    User JOIN Member JOIN Course
    ON User.id = Member.user_id AND Member.course_id = Course.id
    ORDER BY User.name DESC, Course.title DESC, Member.role DESC LIMIT 2;
```

The output should look as follows:

```
Zulaikha|si334|0
Zofia|si364|0
```

Once that query gives the correct data, run this query:

```sql
SELECT 'XYZZY' || hex(User.name || Course.title || Member.role ) AS X FROM
    User JOIN Member JOIN Course
    ON User.id = Member.user_id AND Member.course_id = Course.id
    ORDER BY X LIMIT 1;
```

You should get one row with a string that looks like `XYZZY53656C696E613333`.
